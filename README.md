# Playground projects
This repo is the central place for my private projects managed as a monorepo.

It contains my react implementation of [bulma.io](bulma.io) written in Typescript.

It serves as a playground for projects and for testing new tools.

To see the storybook of components check out the repo, browse into `common` and run `npm i && npm run storybook`.

For the random-quote-client check out the repo, browse into `random-quotes` and run `npm i && npm start`.
